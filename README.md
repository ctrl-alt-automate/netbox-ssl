## ✨ Why NetBox SSL?

Managing SSL certificates across your infrastructure shouldn't be a scavenger hunt. NetBox SSL brings **visibility** and **control** to your certificate lifecycle:

- 🔍 **See everything at a glance** — Know which certificates are expiring, where they're deployed, and who owns them
- 🔄 **Painless renewals** — The Janus workflow transfers all assignments automatically when you renew
- 🔒 **Security first** — Private keys are never stored, only location hints for your secret management system
- 🎯 **Deep integration** — Certificates link directly to NetBox Services, Devices, and VMs

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version |
|------------|---------|
| NetBox     | 4.4.0 - 4.5.x |
| Python     | 3.10+ |

The plugin uses the Python [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/) library for X.509 certificate parsing (installed automatically as a dependency).

## Installation

```bash
pip install netbox-ssl
```

Add to your `configuration.py`:

```python
PLUGINS = ["netbox_ssl"]
```

Run migrations and restart NetBox:

```bash
python manage.py migrate netbox_ssl
sudo systemctl restart netbox netbox-rq
```

**That's it!** Navigate to *Plugins > SSL Certificates* in your NetBox.

📖 **Full documentation:** [docs/](docs/index.md)

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize the plugin via `PLUGINS_CONFIG` in your `configuration.py`:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "netbox_ssl": {
        "expiry_warning_days": 30,   # Days before expiry → Warning status
        "expiry_critical_days": 14,  # Days before expiry → Critical status
    },
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `expiry_warning_days` | Integer | 30 | Certificates expiring within this many days show warning status |
| `expiry_critical_days` | Integer | 14 | Certificates expiring within this many days show critical status |
| `notification_email_enabled` | Boolean | False | Enable email notifications for expiry reports |
| `notification_email_recipients` | List | [] | Default email recipients for notifications |
| `bulk_import_max_batch_size` | Integer | 100 | Maximum certificates per bulk import request |
| `expiry_scan_thresholds` | List | [14, 30, 60, 90] | Days-before-expiry thresholds for the expiry scan script |
| `expiry_scan_cooldown_hours` | Integer | 24 | Minimum hours between duplicate event notifications |

See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for more options including custom fields, permissions, and webhooks.

## Features

### Smart Paste Import
Just paste your PEM certificate — the plugin extracts everything automatically: Common Name, SANs, validity dates, issuer chain, fingerprints, and more.

### Janus Renewal Workflow
When you import a renewed certificate (same CN as an existing one), the plugin offers to:
- **Preview assignments** that will be transferred in a detailed table
- **Transfer all assignments** from the old certificate atomically
- **Archive the old certificate** with "Replaced" status
- **Link them together** for audit trail

Start a renewal directly from the certificate detail page with the **Renew** button.

### Certificate Authority Tracking
Track your CAs (Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, Sectigo, internal CAs) with automatic detection based on issuer patterns.

### Certificate Signing Requests (CSR)
Track pending certificate requests through their lifecycle: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Issued.

### Chain Validation
Validate certificate chains for completeness, signature correctness, and expiry.

### Compliance Reporting
Define compliance policies (minimum key size, forbidden algorithms, max validity, etc.) and run checks across your certificate inventory. 10 built-in policy types with severity levels and scoring.

### Data Export
Export certificates in CSV, JSON, YAML, or PEM bundle format with configurable field selection.

### Bulk CSV/JSON Import
Import certificate metadata from CSV or JSON files — paste content or upload a file. Two-step workflow with preview and validation before creating certificates. Also available via API.

### ACME Certificate Monitoring
Track Let's Encrypt and other ACME-issued certificates with auto-detection, renewal status, and provider metadata. Supports 7+ ACME providers.

### Email Notifications
Receive email alerts when certificates are expiring. Configurable recipients, thresholds, and subject prefix. Sends HTML + plain-text reports.

### Certificate Assignments
Link certificates to the objects that use them:
- **Services** (recommended) — Port-level granularity (e.g., HTTPS on port 443)
- **Devices** — Physical servers and appliances
- **Virtual Machines** — VMs in your virtualization clusters

### Expiry Dashboard Widget
Add the widget to your NetBox dashboard to see:
- 🔴 **Critical** — Expiring within 14 days
- 🟠 **Warning** — Expiring within 30 days
- ⚫ **Orphan** — Certificates without assignments

### Security by Design
- **No private key storage** — Private keys never touch the database
- **Private key rejection** — PEM input with private keys is blocked
- **Key location hints** — Document where keys are stored (e.g., `vault:secret/certs/example.com`)
